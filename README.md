# Reeborg Hurdle 3 Solutions 🧩

This repository contains *two Python solutions* for the *Hurdle 3* challenge in [Reeborg’s World](https://reeborg.ca/).

Both solutions make Reeborg reach the goal by jumping over walls, but they use *different approaches*.

---

## 🧠 Approaches

### 1️⃣ Basic Solution (hurdle3_basic_solution.py)
- Uses only if and else inside a single loop.
- Simple and direct logic.
- Best for beginners.

### 2️⃣ Functional Solution (hurdle3_functional_solution.py)
- Uses custom functions (jump() and think()) to organize the code.
- Easier to read and maintain.
- Demonstrates modular programming.

---

## 💡 Key Learnings
- How to use *functions* to make code reusable.
- How to control loops with while not at_goal():.
- How to use *conditional logic* to react to the environment (front_is_clear() and wall_on_right()).
